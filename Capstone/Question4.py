#Implement the MYPY Phone Book System in Python as per Figure 3 below which allows
#users to add, delete, update and lookup phone numbers. The MYPY Phone Book System
#should store the individualâ€™s Full Name and Phone Number. Your program should not allow
#users to add the same number twice. On adding, deleting, updating or looking up a number,
#your program should let the user know if the operation was successful or not. On looking up
#a number return the full name and number of the individual; if the number is not found give
#the user the option to add the details they are looking up. The user can perform multiple
#actions; they can add a new entry and subsequently delete an entry without having to stop and
#start the program until they decide to quit.
